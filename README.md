# All the discord modding community drama.
I listed every kinda of known drama about the problematic discord modding community, that sadly has a bad history.
I hope that everything gets better any day.
Also everything here is in the chronological date, or at least I tried to put.
If you wanna add more, free feel to make a issue or a PR.

## Known Dates

- BetterDocs/DiscordSource
  - It was a famous website where BD plugins and themes are distributed. But these wasn't distributed without permission of the plugin and themes respective devs. Luckily for us it got shut down after a time.
- Powercord VS Vizality
  - A fork of [Powercord](https://github.com/powercord-org) was made by Baked/dperolio called [Vizality](https://github.com/vizality). One of the Powercord devs, Bowser65, didn't liked to have the idea of a fork ofFix  her product, so she's trying her best to end this fork. But really nobody asked for a war against it.
- Powercord New License
  - Some weeks after Vizality's fork was known, Powercord devs made a new license for the project called [Porkord](https://github.com/powercord-org/powercord/blob/v2/LICENSE). One theory to why this license exists is to try stop Vizality's development, since it only allows forks if a permission is given from devs. Read that quote:
  > All Rights Reserved. You are not allowed to redistribute this software, or use
the software to build derivative works based upon without prior written permission.
- DB/NFLD Message Logger Ban Attempt
  - *need to write more*
- BD Swishilicous Ban
  - For some reason Pu, admin from BetterDiscord's secondary server, thought that a user called [Swishilicous](https://github.com/Swishilicous) was giving message loggers to users. According to that user, he wasn't giving message loggers.
- Pu's Wrath
- The Saza Oopsie
  - *need to write more*
- The Muting of A user
  - Actually me (A user) got muted 2 times on Powercord server. The first one was when I was talking about distros, and then Bowser65 criticized about my distro that I was using in that moment, Ubuntu. Then I got angry and we started to quarrel about Arch and Ubuntu, and in the end I got muted after that. I got unmuted after a time. The second I still don't know why it happened, and yes I'm still muted. If you (Bowser65) is reading this, please consider a unmute.
- The Powercord Nuke (and hellbound)
  - Around the 14th September 2020, hellbound got muted in the Powercord server, later (01:47:36 UTC+1), he pushed (obfuscated) malicious code to all of his plugins with the goal of grabbing Powercord staff’s tokens. He did succeed, and got a staff’s token (Ben’s) and managed to delete all of Powercord’s channels and roles under staff and privated all his plugin’s repositories. Even later, wave 2, his plugins went public, but this time, with the intention of grabbing everyone’s tokens.
